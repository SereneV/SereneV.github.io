<article style=background-color:#ffffcc> <p> <strong> Article 1: </strong> This sction will have two articles grouped together. The section containers are used to group other elements together, usually for positioning purposes so we will use them more in the later lessons. Elements may also be grouped toherher in a section  so that the area of the paged grouped by the section can be formatted with the same style, or background color such as this example. </p>  </article>   
<article style=background-color:#ffffcc> <p> <strong> Article 2: </strong> The articles do not necessarily have to go inside the section, however if the articles are to be formatted into a single container, for example they need to be positioned or sixed together, you can acheive this by placing both in a single section and formatting the section. The articles will inherit tthe formatting applied to the section.</p> </article>
