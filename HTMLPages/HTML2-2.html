<h2> Creating a BAD First Impression</h2>    
    
 <ul style= "background-color: #6c8cd5">
 <li> <strong>Sloppy Language:</strong> No matter how well you dress, using sloppy language will lessen your credibility with others. For example, saying "yeah" instead of "yeah",or using profanity, especially around  people that would not find it impressive. Most people consider your choice of words direct reflection of your intelligence. </li> 
     
<li> <strong> Giggling:</strong> While laughter can be the best medicine for many ills, giggling can be annoying. </li>
     
<li> <strong> Hiding Your Hands:</strong> Believe it or not, etiquette research has shown that hands above board are more appealing than hands hidden away in pockets. When your hands are not showing, it often sends a signal to someone that you are not telling all or that you are holding something back.
    
<li> <strong> Gum-Chewing: </strong> Let there be no doubt about it, you should not chew gum when meeting people. No exceptions. </li>
     
<li> <strong> Throat Clearing: </strong> The habit of clearing your throat several times during a conversation can be very distracting.  </li>
